# FashonMNIST-VAE
 A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) implemented in PyTorch, trained on the FashionMNIST dataset. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how VAEs can be used for unsupervised learning and generative modeling, allowing us to encode and reconstruct fashion images while learning meaningful latent representations.

## Features
- Implements a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** with PyTorch.
- Trained on the **FashionMNIST dataset**.
- Supports **latent space exploration and image generation**.
- Provides visualization of latent space interpolations.
- Generates **colorized versions** of FashionMNIST images.
